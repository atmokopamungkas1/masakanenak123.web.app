##### Steps to make Meat gravy:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

Remove the roasted meat from the roasting pan and pour the drippings into a measuring cup. You&#39;ll notice the fat from the drippings will rise to the top, and you&#39;ll want to skim it off to prevent a slick, greasy gravy. You can use a spoon to remove the fat, but we like using a fat separator. Place the roasting pan with the pan juices on the stovetop over high heat until the meat juices begin to bubble, taking care not to burn the juice as it bubbles up quickly. Pour in the red wine and scrape all the bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula.
