Hey everyone, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, paella. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Add saffron threads, bay leaf, parsley, chicken stock, and lemon zest. Stir until well combined and bring to a boil. Watch for most of the liquid to be absorbed and the rice at the top nearly tender. (If for some reason your rice is still uncooked, add Â¼ cup more water or broth and continue cooking). Stir in uncooked rice, tomatoes, bay leaves, salt, oregano, and turmeric.
