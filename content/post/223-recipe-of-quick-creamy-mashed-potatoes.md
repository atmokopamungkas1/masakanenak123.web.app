Mash the potatoes over low heat, allowing all. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce heat so it&#39;s simmering rapidly. To ensure the potatoes stay hot, warm the milk and butter in a small saucepan before folding it into the mash, otherwise the cold dairy cools down the hot potatoes. Make sure to stir the dairy in just until combined, as every time you stir, you lose a little fluff and gain gumminess.
