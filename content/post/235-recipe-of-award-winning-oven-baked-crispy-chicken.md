First, the mayo adds a layer of moisture and fat that keeps the chicken itself super juicy while it bakes. Second, and probably most important, the fat helps coat the breading while it bakes, crisping individual breadcrumbs and adding a boost of flavor and fat that mimics pan-fried chicken. Pound chicken breasts to ½ inch thickness. In a separate shallow dish, combine flour, salt and pepper.
