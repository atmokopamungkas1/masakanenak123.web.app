Heat any cream, milk, butter, or flavorings before you add them to the mashed potatoes. This will keep the potatoes hot and also keep them fluffy. Add more to taste, along with salt and pepper. To ensure the potatoes stay hot, warm the milk and butter in a small saucepan before folding it into the mash, otherwise the cold dairy cools down the hot potatoes.
