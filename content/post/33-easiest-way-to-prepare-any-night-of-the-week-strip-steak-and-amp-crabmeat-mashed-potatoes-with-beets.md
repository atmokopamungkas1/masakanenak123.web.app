##### Steps to make Strip Steak &amp; Crabmeat Mashed Potatoes with Beets:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

The strip steak (sirloin in Britain, Australia, and South Africa) is a cut of beef steaks from the short loin of a cow. It consists of a muscle that does little work, the longissimus, making the meat particularly tender, although not as tender as the nearby psoas major or tenderloin. Unlike the tenderloin, the longissimus is a sizable muscle. Alternatively, for a slight twist, you can smoke the Strip to perfection with the added smoky flavor of your choice. Light a dozen or so pieces of charcoal on one side of the grill.
