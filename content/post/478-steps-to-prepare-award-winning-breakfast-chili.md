Add everything, undrained, to a large pot over medium-high heat and bring to a slow boil, stirring occasionally. I recommend starting on the low end of the spice spectrum and adding to fit your spice preferences at the end. Brown sausage in a pan until no longer pink and is completely done. Add salsa, tomatoes, cumin, and chili powder to the sausage and stir.

Chili with eggs (breakfast chili if you will) is a deeply soul satisfying way to start the day and, in my opinion, the best way to enjoy leftover chili!. Often times I&#39;m barely ready for breakfast at lunch time (I can&#39;t eat when I first get up - it&#39;s a thing). So chili with eggs is my way of joining the menfolk (and Josie!) in their game day eating, with a bit of a &#34;morning&#34; twist. Breakfast chili is made with breakfast meats rather than ground beef.

##### Steps to make Breakfast Chili:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

So chili with eggs is my way of joining the menfolk (and Josie!) in their game day eating, with a bit of a &#34;morning&#34; twist. Breakfast chili is made with breakfast meats rather than ground beef. Breakfast sausage is loaded with herbs and seasonings already, so it really adds a lot of great flavor to the chili while bacon deepens the flavor with its smoky touch. This homemade chili has less liquid in it than a traditional chili, making it thicker like a gravy. Thaw and finely chop sausage patties.
