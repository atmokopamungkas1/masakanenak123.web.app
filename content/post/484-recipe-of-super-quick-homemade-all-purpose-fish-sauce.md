Made with sour cream, mayonnaise, garlic, lime juice, and hot sauce—this highly-rated sauce recipe adds a flavor kick to fish or shrimp tacos. &#34;Absolutely delicious and easy to throw together,&#34; says reviewer Gely. &#34;I doubled the sriracha for an extra kick. Will definitely whip this up again.&#34; Small fish like anchovies are coated in salt and packed in large barrels to hang out. The natural bacterias start to break down the fish, producing a briny, fishy, savory liquid.
