Slow-Cooker Peanut Chicken. &#34;My wife loved this dish and it was so easy to make. To give this a more Thai flavor I would substitute a can of coconut milk for the chicken stock and add a spoonful of curry paste (I use Thai Kitchens Red Curry). I cut up fresh chicken, put in a bag with the remaining slow-cooker ingredients and freeze. To cook, simply remove the bag a day ahead to thaw in the fridge, then pour all the contents into the slow cooker. —Sarah Newman, Brooklyn Center, Minnesota.
