When it comes to pasta, it has to be dried, for my preference. When it comes to noodles, it has to be freshly handmade. Fresh pasta just doesn&#39;t have that chewy springy texture as compared to dried pasta. Tom Yum Linguine ~ Linguine wokked with mushrooms, lemongrass, spring onions, onions, fresh garlic and tomato in roasted chilli and Tom Yum pastes and stir-fry sauce, with just a dash of lemon juice.
